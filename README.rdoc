== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Ruby Version >=2.2.1

Rails version >= 4.0.0

Controller Specs will only pass when we comment the before_filer statement.

I have created the logic for the Reporting module and I only need to display the data in view.


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
